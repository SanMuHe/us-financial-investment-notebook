# Custodial Account

Custodial account, also known as UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) or UTMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account, are account at a financial institution, mutual fund company, or brokerage firm that an adult controls for a minor. When the minor reaches the age of majority (typically 18, 21 or 25 years depending on the state) the money automatically becomes his or hers.

The main benefits of a custodial account are that you can take advantage of the [gift tax](../Tax/gift-tax.md) exclusion, and still have broad control how the money is invested and spent while your child is a minor.

## UGMA vs. UTMA

* UTMA account can hold virtually any kind of asset, including real estate, intellectual property, and works of art.
* UGMA account are limited to financial assets of cash, securities—stocks, bonds, or mutual funds—annuities, and insurance policies.
* All U.S. states allow UGMA account. However, some states do not allow UTMA account.

## Kiddie Tax

Every child younger than 19 (or 24 for full-time students) who files as part of their parents' tax return is allowed a certain amount of [unearned income](../Tax/unearned-income.md) at a reduced tax rate. In 2019, for example, the first $1,050 is considered tax-free, and the next $1,050 is taxed at the child’s bracket, which is 10% for federal income tax. Anything above those amounts is taxed at the parents' rate. This exemption is per child, not per account.

## Eligible Expenses

A custodian can initiate a withdrawal for the benefit of the child, as long as the expenses are for legitimate needs. Unlike 529 plans, these expenses are not limited to education and can be used for anything related to the child.

## Disadvantages

The first disadvantage of custodial account is the impact to financial aid. Because the money in a custodial account is your child's asset and not yours, federal financial aid formulas consider 20% of the money available to pay for college. Compare this to 529 plans, which are given more favorable treatment for financial aid. (The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) formula considers a maximum of 5.6% of the money to be available in a parent owned 529 plan available for college because the money is considered the parent's assets and not the child's.)

The second disadvantage of custodial account is but when kid reaches the age of majority, the account reverts to him/her and he/she can use the money for anything he/she wants - college, a new car, a vacation or something else entirely. Once your child is considered an adult by the state, you no longer have legal control over the account. In contrast, 529 plans gives you much more control over how the funds are used, including the ability to change beneficiaries as the need arises. The main limitation being that the funds must be used specifically for certain education expenses in order to receive tax advantages.
