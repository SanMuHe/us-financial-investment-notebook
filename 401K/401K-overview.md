# 401(k) Plan Overview

A 401(k) is a feature of a qualified profit-sharing plan that allows employees to contribute a portion of their wages to individual accounts.

* Elective salary deferrals are excluded from the employee’s taxable income (except for designated Roth deferrals).
* Employers can contribute to employees’ accounts.
* Distributions, including earnings, are includible in taxable income at retirement (except for qualified distributions of designated Roth accounts).

## Types of 401(k)

There are several types of 401(k) plans available to employers - traditional 401(k) plans, safe harbor 401(k) plans and SIMPLE 401(k) plans. Different rules apply to each.

### Traditional 401(k) plans

A traditional 401(k) plan allows eligible employees to make pre-tax elective deferrals through payroll deductions. Rules relating to traditional 401(k) plans require that contributions made under the plan meet specific nondiscrimination requirements. In order to ensure that the plan satisfies these requirements, the employer must perform annual tests, known as the Actual Deferral Percentage (ADP) and Actual Contribution Percentage (ACP) tests, to verify that deferred wages and employer matching contributions do not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees.

### Safe harbor 401(k) plans

A safe harbor 401(k) plan is another type of 401(k). Unlike a traditional 401(k) plan, it is not subject to the complex annual nondiscrimination tests that apply to traditional 401(k) plans. 401(k) safe harbor plans are popular at small businesses because employers avoid the time and money involved in the nondiscrimination tests. However, employer is required to contribute to its employees’ safe harbor plans.

### SIMPLE 401(k) plans

The SIMPLE 401(k) plan was created so that small businesses could have an effective, cost-efficient way to offer retirement benefits to their employees. A SIMPLE 401(k) plan is not subject to the annual nondiscrimination tests that apply to traditional 401(k) plans. As with a safe harbor 401(k) plan, the employer is required to make employer contributions that are fully vested. This type of 401(k) plan is available to employers with 100 or fewer employees who received at least $5,000 in compensation from the employer for the preceding calendar year. Employees who are eligible to participate in a SIMPLE 401(k) plan may not receive any contributions or benefit accruals under any other plans of the employer.

### Solo 401(k) plans

A solo, or one-participant, 401(k) plan is a traditional 401(k) plan geared specifically for a business owner with no employees. Unlike a traditional 401(k) plan, you do not need to conduct annual nondiscrimination testing with a solo 401(k) plan.

### Roth 401(k) plans

A Roth contribution program to a 401(k) plan is similar to a traditional 401(k) plan. However, contributions to a Roth 401(k) plan are considered post-tax deductions.

## Contribution Types

### Contributions Made By Employees

The following types of contributions are made by employees and must be fully vested at all times, regardless of the employee’s length of service with the company.

#### Salary Deferrals

These are the 401(k) contributions that come out of employee paychecks. They may also be called __elective deferrals__, and they can be made as either pre-tax (a.k.a., tax-deferred) contributions or Roth contributions. Both pre-tax and Roth deferrals are subject to what is called the ADP Test each year, and they are generally not available for in-service distribution before age 59&#189;.

#### Roth Contributions  

The full name in the regulations is __designated Roth contribution__, but they are sometimes called Roth deferrals. Unlike pre-tax deferrals, employees are subject to income tax on these amounts at the time of contribution; however, if left in the plan long enough, they are tax-free (including all investment gains) at the time of distribution.

#### Catch-Up Contributions

These are additional salary deferrals that are available to those participants who are at least age 50 and who are already making deferrals up to the limit. They are disregarded for nondiscrimination testing purposes.

#### After-Tax Contributions

Although it is reasonable to think these are the same as a Roth contribution, they are actually quite different. Similar to Roth, these so-called __voluntary contributions__ are taxed at the time of contribution; however, when it comes to future distributions, all investment gains remain subject to tax. After-tax contributions are combined with company matching contributions and tested via the ACP Test. After-tax contributions are not subject to the same age 59&#189;  restriction when it comes to in-service distributions.

#### Rollovers

Rollovers are amounts that an employee elects to move into a plan from another company-sponsored retirement plan or IRA. They can be either Roth or pre-tax and are generally not included in any nondiscrimination tests.

### Contributions Made By Employers

#### Matching Contributions

These are amounts that the company contributes on behalf of employees who make salary deferrals. Matching contributions can be discretionary, leaving the company to decide on the amount each year, or they can be hard-coded into the plan document and mandatory. The match is the only type of contribution that can be conditioned on participants contributing for themselves, and they are subject to the ACP test. Matching contributions can be subject to a vesting schedule.

#### Qualified Matching Contribution

Abbreviated as QMAC, this is a special type of match that is used to correct certain nondiscrimination testing issues. They must be fully vested at all times, and they are subject to the same distribution restrictions as salary deferrals. Safe harbor matching contributions are QMACs.

#### Profit Sharing Contributions

The "legal" name is the __nonelective contribution__, because unlike a match, the employee does not have to elect to defer in order to share in a nonelective contribution. In fact, there is a rule that specifically prohibits conditioning receipt of a profit sharing contribution on making 401(k) deferrals. The contributions can be subject to vesting, and depending on the method used to allocate them to participants, there may or may not be any separate nondiscrimination testing requirement. Although it is possible to have a profit sharing formula hard-wired into a plan, it is far and away more common for them to be discretionary, allowing the company to decide from one year to the next if a contribution will be made and, if so, how much.

#### Qualified Nonelective Contribution

 Similar to the QMAC, a QNEC is a special type of nonelective contribution that is also used to correct failed nondiscrimination tests. Other types of plan corrections are also made via QNECs. They must be fully vested and are subject to the same distribution restrictions.

## Contribution Limits

### Deferral limits

The limit on employee elective deferrals in 2019 is

* $19,000 for traditional and safe harbor 401(k) plans
* $13,000 for SIMPLE 401(k) plans

### Catch-up contributions for those age 50 and over

If permitted by the 401(k) plan, participants who are age 50 or over at the end of the calendar year can also make catch-up contributions. The additional elective deferrals you may contribute is:

* $6,000 in 2015 - 2019 to traditional and safe harbor 401(k) plans
* $3,000 in 2015 - 2019 to SIMPLE 401(k) plans

### Overall limit on contributions

Total annual contributions (annual additions) to all of your accounts in plans maintained by one employer (and any related employer) are limited. The limit applies to the total of:

* elective deferrals (but not catch-up contributions)
* employer matching contributions
* employer nonelective contributions
* allocations of forfeitures

The annual additions paid to a participant’s account cannot exceed the lesser of:

1. 100% of the participant's compensation, or
2. $56,000 ($62,000 including catch-up contributions) for 2019

However, an employer’s deduction for contributions to a defined contribution plan (profit-sharing plan or money purchase pension plan) cannot be more than 25% of the compensation paid (or accrued) during the year to eligible employees participating in the plan.

## Distribution Rules

401(k) assets can usually be withdrawn only under the following conditions:

* Upon the employee's retirement, death, disability or separation from service with the employer;
* Upon the employee's attainment of age 59&#189;;
* When the employee experiences a hardship as defined under the plan, if the plan permits hardship withdrawals;
* Upon the termination of the plan.

Required minimum distributions (RMDs) must begin at age 70&#189;, unless the participant is still employed and the plan allows RMDs to be deferred until retirement.

Distributions will be counted as ordinary income and assessed a 10% early distribution penalty if the distribution occurs before age 59&#189;, unless an exceptions applies. Exceptions include the following:

* The distributions occur after the death or disability of the employee;
* The distributions occur after the employee separates from service, providing the separation occurs during or after the calendar year that the employee attains age 55;
* The distribution is made to an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) as a part of a divorce or legal separation;
* The employee has deductible medical expenses exceeding 10% of adjusted gross income;
* The distributions are taken as a series of substantially equal periodic payments over the participant's life or the joint lives of the participant and beneficiary;
* The distribution represents a timely correction of excess contributions or deferrals;
* The distribution is as a result of an IRS levy on the employee's account;
* The distribution is not taxable.

The exceptions for higher-education expenses and first-time home purchases only apply to IRAs.

The majority of retirees who draw income from their 401(k)s choose to roll over the amounts to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A rollover allows them to escape the limited investment choices that are often presented in 401(k) accounts. Employees who have employer stock in their plans are also eligible to take advantage of the "net unrealized appreciation" rule (NUA) and receive capital gains treatment on the earnings.

## Loans

Plan loans are another way that employees can access their plan balances, but several restrictions apply. First, the loan option is available at the employer's discretion – if the employer chooses not to allow plan loans, no loans will be available. If this option is allowed, then up to 50% of the employee's vested balance can be accessed, providing the amount does not exceed $50,000, and it must usually be repaid within five years. However, 401(k) loans used for primary home purchases can be repaid over longer periods.

The interest rate must be comparable to the rate charged by lending institutions for similar loans. Any unpaid balance left at the end of the term may be considered a distribution and will be taxed and penalized accordingly.
