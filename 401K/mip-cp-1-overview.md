# **MIP CP 1** Overview

**MIP CP 1** stands for _Managed Income Portfolio Class 1_. You can find more details from [Fidelity's website](https://nb.fidelity.com/public/workplacefunds/summary/0632).

## Objective

The fund seeks to preserve your principal investment while earning a level of interest income that is consistent with principal preservation. The fund seeks to maintain a stable net asset value (NAV) of $1 per share, but it cannot guarantee that it will be able to do so. The yield of the fund will fluctuate.

## Strategy

The fund invests in benefit-responsive investment contracts issued by insurance companies and other financial institutions ("Contracts"), fixed income securities, and money market funds. Under the terms of the Contracts, the assets of the fund are invested in fixed income securities (which may include, but are not limited to, U.S. Treasury and agency bonds, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and collective investment vehicles and shares of investment companies that invest primarily in fixed income securities) and shares of money market funds. The fund may also invest in futures contracts, option contracts, and swap agreements. Fidelity Management Trust Company, as investment manager and trustee of the Fidelity Group Trust for Employee Benefit Plans, has claimed an exemption from registration under the Commodity Exchange Act and is not subject to registration or regulation under the Act. At the time of purchase, all Contracts and securities purchased for the fund must satisfy the credit quality standards specified in the Declaration of Separate Fund

## Risk

The Contracts and securities purchased for the fund are backed solely by the financial resources of the issuers of such Contracts and securities. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the manager(s), the plan sponsor, the trustee, the FDIC, or any other government agency. The Contracts purchased by the fund permit the fund to account for the fixed income securities at book value (principal plus interest accrued to date). Through the use of book value accounting, there is no immediate recognition of investment gains and losses on the fund's securities. Instead, gains and losses are recognized over time by periodically adjusting the interest rate credited to the fund under the Contracts. However, while the fund seeks to preserve your principal investment, it is possible to lose money by investing in this fund. The Contracts provide for the payment of certain withdrawals and exchanges at book value during the terms of the Contracts. In order to maintain the Contract issuers' promise to pay such withdrawals and exchanges at book value, the Contracts subject the fund and its participants to certain restrictions. For example, withdrawals prompted by certain events (e.g., layoffs, early retirement windows, spin-offs, sale of a division, facility closings, plan terminations, partial plan terminations, changes in laws or regulations) may be paid at the market value of the fund's securities, which may be less than your book value balance.

Certain investment options offered by your plan (e.g., money market funds, short term bond funds, certain asset allocation/lifecycle funds and brokerage window) may be deemed by the Contract issuers to "compete" with this fund. The terms of the Contracts prohibit you from making a direct exchange from this fund to such competing funds. Instead, you must first exchange to a non-competing fund for 90 days. While these requirements may seem restrictive, they are imposed by the Contract issuers as a condition for the issuer's promise to pay certain withdrawals and exchanges at book value.

## Short Term Redemption Fee

None

## Who May Want To Invest

Someone who seeks a slightly higher yield over the long term than is offered by money market funds, but who is willing to accept slightly more investment risk.

Someone who is interested in balancing an aggressive portfolio with an investment that seeks to provide stability of price.
