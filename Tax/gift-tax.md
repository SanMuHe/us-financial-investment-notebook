# Gift Tax

## What is gift tax

The gift tax is a tax on the transfer of any property by one individual to another while receiving nothing, or less than full value, in return. You make a gift if you give property (including money), or the use of or income from property, without expecting to receive something of at least equal value in return. If you sell something at less than its full value or if you make an interest-free or reduced-interest loan, you may be making a gift. The gift tax applies whether the donor intends the transfer to be a gift or not.

Many people don't get hit with the gift tax, because the IRS generally doesn't care about what you give away to other people unless that giving exceeds the [annual gift tax exclusion](#annual-gift-tax-exclusion) or the [lefttime gift tax exclusion](#lifetime-gift-tax-exclusion). And even if it does, it might mean you just have to fill out some paperwork.

## Annual gift tax exclusion

* In 2019, you can give up $15,000 to someone in a calendar year and don't have to deal with IRS about it.
* If you give more than $15,000 in a calendar year to anyone person, you need to file a gift tax return. That doesn't mean you have to pay a gift tax. It just means you need to file [IRS Form 709](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-709) to disclose the gift. The gift tax return is just to keep track of your [lifetime gift tax exclusion](#lifetime-gift-tax-exclusion).
* The annual exclusion is per receipient.
* The annual exclusion is per donor.
* Gifts between spouses are unlimited in generally. But if gift is made to spouses who are not U.S. citizens, there is an annual exclusion of $152,000.

## Lifetime gift tax exclusion

* The lifetime gift tax exclusion is the total amount you can give away tax-free over the course of your entire lifetime. At 2019, it is $11.4 million.
* The lifetime gift exclusion is per donor.
* Gifts made each year in excess of the the annual exclusion ($15,000 in 2019) per recipient reduce your lifetime gift tax exclusion. For example, if you give your kid a gift of $115,000 in year 2019. The first $15,000 is not taxable because of the annual exclusion. After that, though, the remaining $100,000 counts against your lifetime exclusion. That means, you lifetime exclusion will become $11.3 million.
* The lifetime gift tax exclusion ties directly to the federal [estate tax](https://smartasset.com/taxes/all-about-the-estate-tax). The federal estate tax kicks in for estates that are worth more than $11.4 million, the same amount as the lifetime gift tax exclusion.

## What is the gift tax rate

The rates range from 18% to 40%, and the giver generally pays the tax. There are, of course, exceptions and special rules for calculating the tax, so see the [instructions to IRS Form 709](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-709) for all the details.

## Foreign Gift

In general, a foreign gift is money or other property received by a U.S. person from a foreign person that the recipient treats as a gift or bequest and excludes from gross income. No gift tax applies to gifts from foreign nationals if those gifts are not situated in the U.S. In legal terms, the gift isn't "U.S. situs" property.

But you still need to file [IRS Form 3520](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f3520.pdf), if during the current tax year you receive

* Gifts or bequests valued at more than $100,000 from a nonresident alien individual or foreign estate (including foreign persons related to that nonresident alien individual or foreign estate)

or

* Gifts valued at more than $16,076 for 2018 (adjusted annually for inflation) from foreign corporations or foreign partnerships (including foreign persons related to the foreign corporations or foreign partnerships)
