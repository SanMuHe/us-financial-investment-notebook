# Tax Treatment of Capital Losses

Capital loss happens when you have a negative profit after selling an investment asset such as a stock, bond, mutual fund, or real estate.

## Capital Losses Tax Rules

### Tax Deductible Capital Losses

Capital losses on the sale of investment property are tax deductible. But capital losses on the sale of personal property are not.

### Overall Capital Losses

Short-term capital losses offset short-term capital gains and long-term capital losses offset long-term gains.
When your short-term gains or losses plus your long-term gains or losses result in a loss when added together, you have an overall loss that can be deducted against your other income.

### Carryover Losses Retain Their Character

A short-term loss you carry over to the next tax year is added to short-term losses occurring in that year. A long-term loss you carry over to the next tax year is added to long-term losses occurring in that year. A long-term capital loss you carry over to the next year reduces that year's long-term gains before its short-term gains.

### Capital Losses Tax Deduction Limit

You can only use $3,000 capital losses per year to deduct from your other income. If you capital losses are more than $3,000 in a year, the amount exceed $3,000 can be carried over to following years and can be applied to capital gains and income at that time.

Please note the capital losses carried over to following years are first used to offset the capital gains and then used to deduct other income. Below is an example
> Let's assume you sell a stock and realize a $20,000 loss. You have no capital gains that year. First, you use $3,000 of the loss to offset ordinary income. The remaining $17,000 will carry over to the next year. Next year, if you have $5,000 of capital gain, you can use $5,000 of your remaining loss carryover to offset this gain, $3,000 to deduct against ordinary income, and the remaining $9,000 will then carry forward to the next tax year. If you had no realized capital gains for the following 3 years, the remaining $9,000 tax loss would be used up, $3,000 at a time, over those 3 years.
