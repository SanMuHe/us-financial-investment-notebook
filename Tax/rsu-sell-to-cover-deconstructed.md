# RSU Sell to Cover Deconstructed

When I receive Restricted Stock Units (RSU) from my employer, I notice there is always a portion of the shares have been automatically sold by the broker.
I know the automatic selling of my RSU is related to income tax withholding. But I have never been so clear about the details until I read the example in [this post](https://thefinancebuff.com/rsu-sell-to-cover-deconstructed.html) from [The Finance Buff](https://thefinancebuff.com).

## Let Us Look At The Example

> You have 100 RSU vested on 05/15. The close price on the vesting date is $50 per share. The company sold 40 shares for taxes. You received 60 shares. Without the RSU, your W-2 income for the year would have been $60,000, with $8,000 withheld for various taxes (federal, state, social security, and etc.).

This transaction can be deconstructed into 5 steps as follows.

### 1. The company gives you a cash bonus

In this example, the bonus is $5,000, which is the close price on the vesting date ($50) times the number of RSU vested (100). The company adds this cash bonus to your W-2. If your W-2 income without the RSU is $60,000, your W-2 income with RSU now becomes $65,000. After the end of the year, they will issue you a W-2 showing $65,000 in box 1.

### 2. You use the cash bonus to buy shares

$5,000 bonus buys 100 shares at $50 a share. Buying shares by itself does not trigger any taxes. Your cost basis in these 100 shares is $50 a share, for a total of $5,000.

### 3. The company sells some shares on your behalf for tax withholding

In this example, they sell 40 shares on your behalf. You may have to report sales of stocks on your tax return. The shares are sold after vesting. The sale price may be slightly different from the price at vesting. You have to report on your taxes for this "forced" sale. If you sell some of your remaining shares, you will have to report those on your taxes separately.

Let us assume the sale price for the tax withholding sale was $50.60 and the broker's commission was $5. The net proceeds of the sale was $50.60 * 40 â€“ $5 = $2,019. You report on your taxes:

* Description:  40 Shares XYZ Corp
* Date Acquired: 5/15/2019
* Date Sold: 5/16/2019
* Proceeds: $2,019
* Cost Basis: $2,000
* Gain or Loss: $19

If the shares are sold at a lower price, you show a loss instead of a gain. For tax around capital loss, please take a look at [Tax Treatment of Capital Losses](tax-treatment-of-capital-losses.md).

### 4. You hand over the money from the stock sale to your employer

Your employer remits the money to the federal and state tax authorities. They add the taxes paid to the withholding numbers on your W-2. If your tax withholdings without RSU would have been $8,000, your tax withholdings with RSU now become $10,000. After the year end, the W-2 you receive from your employer shows $65,000 of income (step 1) and $10,000 in withholdings.

### 5. Finally, your employer gives you the remaining shares

You bought 100 shares in step 2. They sold 40 shares on your behalf in step 3. You have 60 shares left.

### When you file your tax return for this year

* Enter the income and taxes paid from your W-2 as-is. The RSU related income and tax withholdings are already included on your W-2. You don't have to do anything else with them. Do not add more income. Do not add more taxes paid.
* Report the stock sale as shown in step 3.

Your cost basis in the remaining shares stays at $50 a share. In this example it's $50 * 60 = $3,000 in total. Whenever you sell these shares, you have to remember this cost basis. If you sell them for more than $50 a share, you have a capital gain. If you sell them for less than $50 a share, you have a capital loss. You will report the gain or loss in the year you sell these remaining shares. The gain/loss will be a short-term gain/loss or a long-term gain/loss depending on your holding period after the vesting date.
